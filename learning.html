									This is an effort to stay sane while socially distancing myself from people in March-April 2020. Here are some songs that I have been putting off learning for weeks/months/years.
									Also included are some notes to myself (or whoever else ever reads this).

								<h3>Pro Zeca</h3>

								<p>
									Pro Zeca was written by Brazilian saxophonist Vitor Assis Brasil in 1974 (I think). I don't know a whole lot about the composer, but was introduced to this by the leader of my Brazilian jazz ensemble this year.
									I tried hard to play meaningful latin basslines here. I also tried to emulate accordion players in my solo, using triads and arpeggios. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai%C3%A3o_(music)">Bai√£o</a> music is very new to me
									and I need to learn more idiomatic phrases here.

								<h3>Tenor Madness</h3>

								<p>
									Tenor Madness is a blues tune that was written by Sonny Rollins in 1956. 
									Here is a version of the song based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_changes">Bird Changes</a>. This progression dismantled any notions I had of
									being a competent blues musician. I found the quick succession of ii-Vs quite tough to negotiate. A very helpful workshop with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Schwartz">Anton Schwartz</a> got me
									thinking beyond the movement offered by these chords and focus on chord tones of the pillar chords here. Hopefully this shows in my solo.

								<h3>Lush Life</h3>
								<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2116877911/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=134221303/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://fraichedb.bandcamp.com/album/songs-ive-been-meaning-to-learn">Songs I&#39;ve Been Meaning To Learn by Fraiche Delhi Boii</a></iframe>

								<p>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lush_Life_(jazz_song)"> Lush Life </a> was written by Billy Strayhorn sometime beyween 1933 and 1936. I've always thought of this as one of the most beatiful songs ever written. 
									I'm particularly intimidated by the complex chord changes and implied chromatic movement in this song. I focused on my chord voicings on the guitar here and
									also took a shot at singing the involved melody. There's definitely room for improvement, but this song has been 'burning inside my brain' for far too long for me to not give it a go.

								<h3>Giant Steps for the Basic Bro</h3>
								<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2116877911/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=464565744/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://fraichedb.bandcamp.com/album/songs-ive-been-meaning-to-learn">Songs I&#39;ve Been Meaning To Learn by Fraiche Delhi Boii</a></iframe>
								<p>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Steps"> Giant Steps </a> is fast. Watch the chord changes fly past. Lose your face, feel disgrace, add Boom-Bap just in case. 
									<br><br>
									Inspired by my guilt around not picking up a book on the Coltrane Matrix and Physics lent to me by a friend (this is for you Alex Goldschmidt). Definitely lots of room for improvement here. Chords came at me super quick even though its at 95bpm.
