									As part of staying sane while socially distancing myself from people in March-April 2020, I have started go back and learn songs I have been putting of for weeks/months/years.
									Here is a set of recordings of these songs (or parts of these songs) with some notes about what I thought about them. This is very much a journal for myself, but I would
									be delighted if it was interesting to someone

								<h3>Tenor Madness</h3>

								<p>
									Tenor Madness is a blues tune that was written by Sonny Rollins in 1956. 
									Here I tried to play a version of the song based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_changes">Bird Changes</a>. While I think of myself as a decent blues soloist,
									I found the quick succession of ii-Vs quite tough to negotiate. A very helpful workshop with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Schwartz">Anton Schwartz</a> got me
									thinking beyond the movement offered by these chords and focus on chord tones of the pillar chords here. Hopefully this shows in my solo.

								<h3>Lush Life</h3>

								<p>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lush_Life_(jazz_song)"> Lush Life </a> was written by Billy Strayhorn sometime beyween 1933 and 1936. I've always thought of this as one of the most beatiful songs ever written. 
									I've always been intimidated by the complex chord changes and implied chromatic movement in this song, but I've decided to give it a go. I focused on my chord voicings on the guitar ahere and
									also took a shot at singing the involved melody. There's definitely room for iprovement here, but this song has been 'burning inside my brain' for far too long.

								<h3>Pro Zeca</h3>
								
								<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2116877911/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=958244886/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://fraichedb.bandcamp.com/album/songs-ive-been-meaning-to-learn">Songs I&#39;ve Been Meaning To Learn by Fraiche Delhi Boii</a></iframe>

								<p>
									Pro Zeca was written by Brazilian saxophonist Vitor Assis Brasil in 1974 (I think). I don't know a whole lot about the composer, but was introduced to this by the leader of my Brazilian jazz ensemble this year.
									I focused on playing meaningful basslines here, and phrasing using triads -- as if on an accordion. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai%C3%A3o_(music)">Bai√£o</a> music is very new to me
									and I need to learn more idiomatic phrases here.
