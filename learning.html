										<h1>Songs I've Been Meaning to Learn</h1>
										<p>Thoughts on learning new songs while socially distancing</p>
									</header>
									<p> This is an effort to stay sane while socially distancing myself from people in March-April 2020. Here are some songs that I have been putting off learning for weeks/months/years.
										Also included are some notes to myself (or whoever else ever reads this).</p>

										<h3>Pro Zeca</h3>

										<p>
											Pro Zeca was written by Brazilian saxophonist Vitor Assis Brasil in 1974 (I think). I don't know a whole lot about the composer, but was introduced to this by the leader of my Brazilian jazz ensemble this year.
											I tried hard to play meaningful latin basslines here. I also tried to emulate accordion players in my solo, using triads and arpeggios. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai%C3%A3o_(music)">Bai√£o</a> music is very new to me
											and I need to learn more idiomatic phrases here.

										<h3>Tenor Madness</h3>
										<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2116877911/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=3684764043/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://fraichedb.bandcamp.com/album/songs-ive-been-meaning-to-learn">Songs I&#39;ve Been Meaning To Learn by Fraiche Delhi Boii</a></iframe>
		
										<p>
											Tenor Madness is a blues tune that was written by Sonny Rollins in 1956. 
											Here is a version of the song based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_changes">Bird Changes</a>. This progression dismantled any notions I had of
											being a competent blues musician. I found the quick succession of ii-Vs quite tough to negotiate. A very helpful workshop with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Schwartz">Anton Schwartz</a> got me
											thinking beyond the movement offered by these chords and focus on chord tones of the pillar chords here. Hopefully this shows in my solo.

										<h3>Lush Life</h3>
										<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2116877911/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=134221303/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://fraichedb.bandcamp.com/album/songs-ive-been-meaning-to-learn">Songs I&#39;ve Been Meaning To Learn by Fraiche Delhi Boii</a></iframe>
		
										<p>
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lush_Life_(jazz_song)"> Lush Life </a> was written by Billy Strayhorn sometime beyween 1933 and 1936. I've always thought of this as one of the most beatiful songs ever written. 
											I'm particularly intimidated by the complex chord changes and implied chromatic movement in this song. I focused on my chord voicings on the guitar here and
											also took a shot at singing the involved melody. There's definitely room for improvement, but this song has been 'burning inside my brain' for far too long for me to not give it a go.

										<h3>Giant Steps for the Basic Bro</h3>
										<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2116877911/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=464565744/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://fraichedb.bandcamp.com/album/songs-ive-been-meaning-to-learn">Songs I&#39;ve Been Meaning To Learn by Fraiche Delhi Boii</a></iframe>
										<p>
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Steps"> Giant Steps </a> is fast. Watch the chord changes fly past. Lose your face, feel disgrace, add Boom-Bap just in case. 
											<br><br>
											Inspired by my guilt around not picking up a book on the Coltrane Matrix and Physics lent to me by a friend (this is for you Alex Goldschmidt). Definitely lots of room for improvement here. Chords came at me super quick even though its at 95bpm.

										<h3>Naima</h3>
										<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2116877911/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=591279356/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://fraichedb.bandcamp.com/album/songs-ive-been-meaning-to-learn">Songs I&#39;ve Been Meaning To Learn by Fraiche Delhi Boii</a></iframe>
										<p>
											Trying to stay in a Coltrane vein. This is much less of a finished/polished track than a lot of the others, and probably way too long.
											<br><br><br>
											
											<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naima"> Naima </a> is another one of my favourite ballads. I've always struggled with ballads -- solo-ing and comping. Figured I'd 
											spend time soloing over this one since I comped on Lush Life. Used <a href="https://www.pgmusic.com/bbwin.htm"> Band in a Box </a>  to enerate some instrument tracks, edited them a bit and went to town (eeep the ignominy).	Struggled a lot to play something pretty here (it really has to be pretty), but 
											especially in the later choruses.

											<h3>Fly Me to the Moon</h3>
											<p>
												I recently enrolled in an online class exploring chord melody arrangements for the guitar. We discussed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon">Fly Me to the Moon</a> in our first lesson. Here is a set of chord melody arrangements of the song, hopefully charting some improvement.
											</p>
											<h4>Try 1: Baseline</h4>
											<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2116877911/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=2252395944/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://fraichedb.bandcamp.com/album/songs-ive-been-meaning-to-learn">Songs I&#39;ve Been Meaning To Learn by Fraiche Delhi Boii</a></iframe>
											<p> This is a baseline effort after my first class. It sounds choppy and there are no interesting basslines, fills or harmonic movement. Also had a hard time implying the beat and needed to add percussion to contextualize the melody.</p>
