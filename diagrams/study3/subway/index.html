    <h1>Subway System Design</h1>
    <p>An urban planner is trying to design a new subway system. They have represented their design with a diagram, where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subway stations are represented by graph nodes.</li>
        <li>Train connections between stations are represented by edges labeled <code>next</code>. These connections are strictly one-way.
            <ul>
                <li>A <code>next</code> edge from <code>Station A</code> to <code>Station B</code> means that there is a a train that goes directly from from <code>Station A</code> to <code>Station B</code>.</li>
                <li>If there is no<code>next</code> edge from <code>Station B</code> to <code>Station A</code>, there is no direct train from <code>Station B</code> to <code>Station A</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            
        </li>
            
        <li>The relative positions of stations are represented by edges labelled <code>north</code> and <code>east</code>.
            <ul>
                <li>A <code>north</code> edge means that the pointed at station is directly north of the pointing station.</li>
                <li>An <code>east</code> edge means that the pointed at station is directly east of the pointing station.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 1</h3>
    <p>What is the southern most station in diagram?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Station0</p>

    <h3>Question 2</h3>
    <p>The subway system is designed so that riders can get <b>to</b> the downtown station from <em>any other</em> station. 
        In terms of the diagram, this means that there is a station that can be reached following <code>next</code> edges from any other station.</p>
    <p>Which station in the diagram is the downtown station?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Station3</p>

    <h3>Question 3</h3>
    <p>Which is the northernmost station from which you can get to Station2?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Station4</p>
<!-- 
    <h3>Question 4 [REMOVED]</h3>
    <p>A good subway system is resilient to train breakdowns and slowdowns. This means that there are sometimes multiple paths between important stations.</p>
    <p>How many paths are there from Station1 to Station4?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 0</p> -->
