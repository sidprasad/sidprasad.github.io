# Poker

The diagram below represents a group of players seated around a table, about to begin a game of poker.
They take turns being the dealer (indicated by them holding the `Dealer0` button). This button, and the responsibility of being dealer, is passed
around the table in a clockwise direction (i.e. to the left).

The two other important positions in poker are defined as follows:

- The 'Small Blind' is the person seated directly clockwise (i.e. to the left) of the dealer.
- The 'Big Blind' is the person seated directly clockwise (i.e. to the left) of the 'Small Blind'.
