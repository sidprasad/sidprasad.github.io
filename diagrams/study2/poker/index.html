    <h1>Poker</h1>
    <p>The diagram below represents a group of players seated around a table, about to begin a game of poker. They take turns being the dealer (indicated by them holding the <code>Dealer0</code> button). This button, and the responsibility of being dealer, is passed around the table in a clockwise direction (i.e. to the left).</p>
    <p>The two other important positions in poker are defined as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The 'Small Blind' is the person seated directly clockwise (i.e. to the left) of the dealer.</li>
        <li>The 'Big Blind' is the person seated directly clockwise (i.e. to the left) of the 'Small Blind'.</li>
    </ul>
