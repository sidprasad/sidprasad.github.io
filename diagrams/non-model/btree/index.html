    A binary tree is a data structure that consists of nodes, where each node can have at most two children and at most one parent.
    Exactly one node in the tree has no parent node. This node is called the root node. Every node in the tree is a descendant of this root node.
    Binary trees are acyclic, meaning that you cannot traverse the tree in a loop. There is exactly one path from the root node to any other node in the tree.
    
     
    A programming student is learning about binary trees.  In order to demonstrate their understanding of the data structure, they have built a diagram of a 9 Node
    binary tree. The edges between the nodes represent parent-child relationships between the nodes.
    <ul>
        <li> If an edge labelled <tt>parent</tt> points from <tt>NodeA</tt> to <tt>NodeB</tt>, this means that <tt>NodeB</tt> is the parent of <tt>NodeB</tt>.</li>
        <li> If an edge labelled <tt>children</tt> points from <tt>NodeA</tt> to <tt>NodeB</tt>, this means that <tt>NodeB</tt> is a child of <tt>NodeA</tt>.</li>
    </ul>


<!-- Q1 : Is this a valid binary tree?

Q2: What is the depth of the tree? That is, The height of the tree is the number of vertices in the tree from the root to the deepest node. -->
