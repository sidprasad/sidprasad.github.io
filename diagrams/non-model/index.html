        <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
        <p>Tic Tac Toe is a game is played on a 3x3 grid, but two players : <strong>X</strong> and <strong>O</strong>. Players take turns placing their mark in an empty cell, and the first player to get three of their marks in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            A game designer has been trying to understand Tic Tac Toe, and has built a diagram to visualize game states.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Each cell is represented by a graph node, and each edge represents a relationship between two cells.
                <ul>
                    <li>For instance, if an edge labelled <tt>right</tt> points from <tt>Cell1</tt> to <tt>Cell2</tt>, this means that <tt>Cell2</tt> is directly to the right of <tt>Cell1</tt>.</li>
                    <li>Similarly, if an edge labelled <tt>down</tt> points from <tt>Cell1</tt> to <tt>Cell2</tt>, this means that <tt>Cell2</tt> is directly below <tt>Cell1</tt>.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If a mark has been placed in a cell, the cell has a&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>mark</tt>&nbsp;label with a value of either<strong> <tt>X</tt> </strong>or <strong><tt>O</tt></strong>.</li>
            </ul>


    <p>Q1: Is this a valid TTT Board?</p>

    <p> If not, briefly tell us why.</p>
    <p> If so, who is the winner?</p>
