        <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
    <p>
        Tic Tac Toe is a game is played on a 3x3 grid, but two players : X and O.
        Players take turns placing their mark in an empty cell, and the first player to
        get three of their marks in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

        The diagram below represents a game of Tic Tac Toe, being played on a 3 x 3 grid. Each cell is represented by a graph node, and each edge represents a relationship between two cells.
        <ul>
            <li>For instance, if an edge labelled <tt>right</tt> points from <tt>Cell1</tt> to <tt>Cell2</tt>, this means that <tt>Cell2</tt> is directly to the right of <tt>Cell1</tt>.</li>
            <li>Similarly, if an edge labelled <tt>down</tt> points from <tt>Cell1</tt> to <tt>Cell2</tt>, this means that <tt>Cell2</tt> is directly below <tt>Cell1</tt>.</li>
        </ul>

        Finally, if a mark has been placed in a cell, the cell will have an attribute <tt>mark</tt> with a value of either <tt>X</tt> or <tt>O</tt>.
    </p>
