    A binary tree is a data structure that consists of nodes, where each node can have up to two children (one one the right and one on the left) and at most one parent.
    A programming student is learning about binary trees.  In order to demonstrate their understanding of the data structure, they have built a diagram of a 10 Node
    binary tree. The edges between the nodes represent parent-child relationships between the nodes.
    <ul>
        <li> If an edge labelled <tt>parent</tt> points from <tt>NodeA</tt> to <tt>NodeB</tt>, this means that <tt>NodeB</tt> is the parent of <tt>NodeB</tt>.</li>
        <li> If an edge labelled <tt>left</tt> points from <tt>NodeA</tt> to <tt>NodeB</tt>, this means that <tt>NodeB</tt> is the left child of <tt>NodeA</tt>.</li>
        <li> If an edge labelled <tt>right</tt> points from <tt>NodeA</tt> to <tt>NodeB</tt>, this means that <tt>NodeB</tt> is the right child of <tt>NodeA</tt>.</li>
    </ul>


    A valid binary tree must satisfy the following conditions:
    <ul>
        <li> Each node in the tree has at most two children. A node can have at most one left child and at most one right child.</li>
        <li> Exactly one node in the tree has no parent node. This node is called the root node.</li>
        <li> Every node in the tree is a descendant of the root node. </li>
        <li> No node in the tree is a descendant of itself. </li>
    
    </ul>

<!-- Q1 : Is this a valid binary tree?

Q2: What is the depth of the tree? That is, The height of the tree is the number of vertices in the tree from the root to the deepest node. -->
