        <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
        
        A game designer has been trying to understand Tic Tac Toe, and has built a diagram to visualize game states.
        <ul>
            <li>Each cell is represented by a graph node, and each edge represents a relationship between two cells.
                <ul>
                <li>For instance, if an edge labelled right points from Cell1 to Cell2, this means that Cell2 is directly to the right of Cell1.</li>
                <li>Similarly, if an edge labelled down points from Cell1 to Cell2, this means that Cell2 is directly below Cell1.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
                <li>If a mark has been placed in a cell, the cell has a  mark label with a value of either <tt>X</tt> or <tt>O</tt>.</li>
        </ul>

        To be valid, a Tic Tac Toe game should be played on a 3x3 grid by two players : <b>X</b> and <b>O</b>. 
        Players take turns placing their mark in an empty cell. Once a cell has been marked, it cannot be overwritten. No cell can contain more than one mark. 
        The first player to place three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.



    <p>Q1: Is this a valid TTT Board?</p>

    <p> If not, briefly tell us why.</p>
    <p> If so, who is the winner?</p>
