test expect {
  injective : {isDirectedTree implies (edges.~edges in iden)} is checked
  injective_insufficient : {(edges.~edges in iden) and !isDirectedTree} is sat

  root : {isDirectedTree implies (lone edges.Node - Node.edges) } is checked
  loopless : {isDirectedTree implies (no (^edges & iden))} is checked
  connected : {isDirectedTree implies (lone Node or Node in edges.Node + Node.edges) } is checked

  roottest : {all r : Node | isRoot[r] implies (no edges.r)}
}


example twoNodeTree is isDirectedTree for {
  Node = `Node1 + `Node2
  edges = `Node1->`Node2
}

example notJustInjective is {not isDirectedTree} for {

	Node =`Node1 + `Node2 + `Node3
    edges = `Node1->`Node3 + `Node2->`Node2 + `Node3->`Node1
}
