<h1> Bio </h1>

<p>I was born in New Delhi, India and currently attend <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/">Tufts University</a> in Medford, Massachusetts, where I study Computer Science and Math. I'm interested in computer architecture, signal processing, emulators and natural language processing. </p>

<p>
In the summer of 2014, I worked at INRIA Saclay with the <a href='https://team.inria.fr/parsifal/'> Parsifal Team </a> and developed a <a href='https://github.com/sidprasad/RewriteVerificationSystem'>Rewrite Verification System</a>.

</p>

<p>
In the summer of 2013, I worked on image restoration problems dealt with in Bertalmio and Sapiro's paper <a href="http://www.tecn.upf.es/~mbertalmio/bertalmi.pdf">'Image Inpainting'</a> under the project 'Aquisition, Representation, Processing and Display of Heritage Sites' at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, where I developed a basic inpainting algorithm.

</p>

<p>
In 2011, I interned at <a href="http://www.gramvaani.org/">Gram Vaani</a>, examining call logs made to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. I wrote code to analyze the call logs and look for patterns such as repeated complaints coming from the same area, comparison of grievance redressal rates across different zones of Delhi and statistics on call volumes. This has been useful to help civic agencies understand how IT automation can reveal insights to help improve their performance.
</p>

<p>I also play the guitar, love jazz, and never miss an Arsenal match. </p>
