  descr: "Model finders (e.g., Alloy and Forge) discover instances of a datatype specification and counterexamples to conjectures. Instances can help users debug their designs, but only if they are properly understood. This paper introduces a visualizer called CnD that avoids misleading diagrams by default and offers a low-code way to communicate domain-specific constraints. CnD helps shed light on ``unknown unknowns'' in the early stages of a specification design."
