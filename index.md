I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by [Shriram Krishnamurthi](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/). I'm especially focused on helping people write programs that behave as they intend. This means that my research touches on programming languages, formal methods, human factors, and education.

Previously, I was a software engineer at Microsoft, where I worked both on Windows[^1] and Azure[^2]. My research interests are informed by my time as an engineer. I have written code that doesn't do what I want it to, and I want to spare everyone else the indignity.




[^1]: I worked on the [XAML UI Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml) from 2016-2018.
[^2]: I worked on [Azure's AI services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services), with a particular focus on containerizing AI from 2018-2021.

      <p class="project-description">
      The most important aspect of a diagram is how it is spatially arranged, not its aesthetic rendering. I am interested in understanding the
      spatial operations that are needed to build useful diagrams.

      <p class="project-description">
        A learner's misconceptions are really alternate semantics in their head.
        This project involves understanding and addressing misconceptions that
        practioners have when working in LTL.

      <p class="project-description">Forge is a sibling of the Alloy language designed with 
      pedagogy in mind. Key features include a gradual progression of (sub)languages,
      unit testing for logical predicates, and support for domain-specific visualizations.

<!-- - I'm particularly proud of my formalization of [Kleene Algebra](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Algebra/Order/Kleene.html) as part of the Lean Mathlib project.
- I try to be involved with the New England Programming Languages community(see talks at [NEPLS 2025](https://nepls.org/Events/34/abstracts.html#prasad), [Racket Con 2022](https://con.racket-lang.org/2022/)) -->
