I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by [Shriram Krishnamurthi](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/). I'm especially focused on helping people write programs that behave as they intend. This means that my research touches on programming languages, formal methods, human factors, and education.

Previously, I was a software engineer at Microsoft, where I worked on the [XAML language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Application_Markup_Language) (2015/2016-2018), and then [Azure's AI services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services) (2018-2021). My research interests are informed by my time as an engineer. I have written code that doesn't do what I want it to, and I want to spare everyone else the indignity.
