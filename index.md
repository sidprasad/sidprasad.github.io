I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Brown University, advised by [Shriram Krishnamurthi](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/). I'm especially focused on helping people write programs that behave as they intend. This means that my research touches on programming languages, formal methods[^1], human factors, and education.

Previously, I was a software engineer at Microsoft, where I worked both on Windows[^2] and Azure[^3]. My research interests are informed by my time as an engineer. I have written code that doesn't do what I want it to, and I want to spare everyone else the indignity.


[^1]: [Not sure what formal methods are? I really like this page.](https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/fm-what.html)

[^2]: I worked on the [XAML UI Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml) from 2016-2018.
[^3]: I worked on [Azure's AI services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services), with a particular focus on containerizing AI from 2018-2021.

### I'm also contributing to

<div class="project-list">

  <a href="https://forge-fm.org" class="project-card-link">
    <div class="project-card">
      <h3 class="project-title">Forge</h3>
      <p class="project-description">Forge is designed to bring lightweight formal
      methods to programmers. Refined over multiple years of teaching, it adds a gradual progression of languages, a toolkit for domain-specific visualizations, and a form of unit testing for logical predicates to the Alloy language.

  <a href="https://blog.brownplt.org/2024/01/01/examplar.html" class="project-card-link">
    <div class="project-card">
      <h3 class="project-title">Examplar</h3>
      <p class="project-description">
      Computer Science students often begin coding with an incomplete understanding of the problem at hand, only realizing their mistake after investing significant effort or receiving instructor feedback. Examplar helps students check their understanding early by letting them write inputâ€“output examples and get instant feedback on whether their example suites are valid and thorough.
